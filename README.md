> CLI Metronome is a simple command-line application that generates beats at a user-specified BPM (beats per minute). It uses the Pygame library for sound effects and the Urwid library for the user interface.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/nkatshiba/cli-metronome)
## Features

- Set the BPM manually or let the program ask you.
- Adjust the BPM using '+' and '-' keys.
- Exit the program using the 'q' key.
## Install

```sh
pip install pygame urwid
```

## Usage
To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the main.py file and run the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```
The program will ask you to enter the BPM. You can either enter a number directly or press 'Enter' to let the program ask you.

Once the program is running, you can adjust the BPM using the '+' and '-' keys. Pressing 'q' will exit the program.
